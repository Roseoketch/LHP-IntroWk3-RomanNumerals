### Description
__*A website that translates numbers into Roman-numerals.*__

Draft some input-output examples to brainstorm the behaviors that you'll want to capture in your application. Tackle them one-by-one, worrying only about the future behaviors once the current example is implemented.

#### Tests:
* 1000 | "M", 2000 | "MM", 3000 | "MMM"
* 2500 | "MMD", 500 | "D"
* 3800 | "MMDCCC", 1300 | "MCCC"
* 1250 | "MCCL", 850 | "DCCCL", 50 | "L"
* 2510 | "MMDX", 360 | "CCCLX", 20 | "XX"
* 3505 | "MMMDV", 735 | "DCCXXXV", 8 | "VIII"
* 1001 | "MI", 852 | "DCCCLII",
* 
* non-numeric input is rejected
* 4000 gives an error
