### Description
__*A website that translates numbers into Roman-numerals.*__

Write a method to convert numbers into Roman numerals.

For some background, Roman numerals are based on seven symbols:

Symbol  Value
I       1
V       5
X       10
L       50
C       100
D       500
M       1,000

The most basic rule is that you add the value of all the symbols: so II is 2, LXVI is 66, etc.

The exception is that you can't have more than three of the same character is a row: instead, you switch to subtraction. So instead of writing IIII for 4, you write IV (for 5 minus 1); and instead of writing LXXXX for 90, you write XC.

You also have to separate ones, tens, hundreds, and thousands. In other words, 99 is XCIX, not IC. With Roman numerals, you can't count higher than 3,999 in Roman numerals.

Draft some input-output examples to brainstorm the behaviors that you'll want to capture in your application. Tackle them one-by-one, worrying only about the future behaviors once the current example is implemented.
